# Iris-Data-Set-Tensorflow

## Problem Sheet 4 with Tensorflow

In this repository we will be taking a look at the Iris data set and investigating its different aspects while using it to train a model in Tensorflow.

TensorFlow is a Python library for fast numerical computing created and released by Google. 
It is a foundation library that can be used to create Deep Learning models directly or by using wrapper libraries that simplify the process built on top of TensorFlow

## Installing needed technologies

You'll will first need to install Python, this can be done by following this link and its instructions, install Python 3 [Pyton Install](https://www.howtogeek.com/197947/how-to-install-python-on-windows/)
Make sure Python is in your enviroment variables path.
To check if Python installed properly, open your cmd and type "Python".

You should then install the Tensorflow library, this is done by opening your cmd and typing "pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow" for the CPU-only version and "pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow-gpu" for the GPU version.

You will need the numpy library too, to do so, open your cmd and enter "pip install numpy-1.12.0+mkl-cp36-cp36m-win32.whl"

Install Jupyter notebook: http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html

Laslty for this example you will need the pandas library, open cmd one last time and enter "pip3 install pandas"

##Iris data set

The data set consists of 5 columns and 150 rows.

These columns are:
* Sepal Length
* Sepal Width
* Petal Length
* Petal Width
* Species(setosa, versicolor, virginica)

##Using this repository

git clone https://github.com/Damian404/Iris-Data-Set-Tensorflow.git

Then open Jupyter notebook and open clone
